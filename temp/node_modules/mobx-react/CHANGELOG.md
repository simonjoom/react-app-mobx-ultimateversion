    name: React.PropTypes.string
};

myComponent.defaultProps = {
    name: "World"
};

export default observer(myComponent);
```

All credits to Jiri Spac for this contribution!

Use React 0.14 instead of React 0.13. For React 0.13, use version `mobx-react@1.0.2` or higher. 

### 1.0.2

Minor fixes and improvements

### 1.0.1

Fixed issue with typescript typings. An example project with MobX, React, Typescript, TSX can be found here: https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-typescript

### 1.0.0

`reactiveComponent` has been renamed to `observer`

### 0.2.3

Added separte import for react-native: use `var reactiveComponent = require('mobx-react/native').reactiveComponent` for native support; webpack clients will refuse to build otherwise.

### 0.2.2

Added react-native as dependency, so that the package works with either `react` or `react-native`.

### 0.2.0

Upgraded to MobX 0.7.0

### 0.1.7

Fixed issue where Babel generated component classes where not properly picked up.

### 0.1.6

`observer` now accepts a pure render function as argument, besides constructor function. For example:

```javascript
var TodoItem = observer(function TodoItem(props) {
    var todo = props.todo;
    return <li>{todo.task}</li>;
});
```

### 0.1.5

observer is now defined in terms of side effects.

### 0.1.4

Added support for React 0.14(RC) by dropping peer dependency
