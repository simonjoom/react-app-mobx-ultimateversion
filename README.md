This thread call react-app-ssr; i did a version fully working with server side rendering, 
But we decided to start from single page application instead, will be easier to maintain!
So see the first "react-app"

# react-app
forked react-app  with fontawesome + mobx + material-ui + https://github.com/kriasoft/react-app



1 - install nginx for mac-os

see:
https://coderwall.com/p/dgwwuq/installing-nginx-in-mac-os-x-maverick-with-homebrew


2 - Install app 


IN root folder of react-app

a) npm install (install babel dependencies)

b) npm run new (this install and deps of my application in ./temp)

normally i checked all dependencies

b) install my config with nginx for proxy
cp -f ./temp/nginx /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

add in /etc/hosts :

127.0.0.1       localhost skiscool.com fr.skiscool.com ru.skiscool.com fr.skiscool.com uk.skiscool.com pt.skiscool.com skiscool.eu

like that we link all my server to localhost 

to check the port running it's in config file .env in ./temp



IMPORTANT:
delete the feathers-authentication installed in ./temp/node_modules/ and replace by mine (i did some little hack to make the new work with my config)
unzip ./temp/feathers-authentication.zip to ./temp/node_modules/




3 Run APP:

First run nginx simply:

sudo nginx (in super user because we listen 80)


* Run server for feathers (watch mode with debug mode authentication)

from ./temp

run:

DEBUG=feathers-authentication:* node bin/server.js  


* Finally Run Application in other console: 

from root (parent of temp folder)

npm start



You re done ! (no need install after new the scalfolding react-app will do for you).

see webpack.config.js for configuration


* add dotenv to control easily application port with a file .env

* cssnano just to optimize css output 

* fontawesome

* copy-webpack-plugin to push asset from a directory (else assets didn't found from memory)

If you have some dependances problem to run it please say me 
on skype simonzkyp or simon@skiscool.com




# react-app/ssr
forked react-app for ssr
see webpackssr.config.js for configuration

Add fonctionnalities

deploy react-app-ssr application: (this work is temporary stopped but should work)
npm run newssr
npm run startssr


Comment developping:

You can add others template

Just need to set a environnement variable with the name of the template (for me ssr)
The name of template folder have to begin by 'app-' 

Name relation:
ex folder /templates/app-mytemplate

 in script "newssr": "template=mytemplate  node ./app/bin/react-app new --test-sdk", in package.json

 webpack.config.js become webpackmytemplate.config.js


I added 
-> 1 webpackconfig for ssr
-> select template in scripts

I removed index.html (it's generated by server.js)

SEO:
In routes i correctly send a 404 response from server to the client for google

I kept browser-sync and hot-middleware, but i use a proxy , i understood that the proxy is important for ssr

New npm:

* webpack-middleware was important to replace over webpack-dev-middleware who is not done for ssr

* add dotenv to control easily application port with a file .env

* cssnano just to optimize css output

* simple-universal-style to push style in server -> important

* isomorphic-fetch for routes (code of core/router nothing change)

* did change in core/history for the server

* copy-webpack-plugin to push asset from a directory (else assets didn't found from memory)
